<h2>Transtial response</h2>
<p><em>Rotational mechanical systems</em> move about a fixed axis. These systems mainly consist of three basic elements. Those are moment of inertia, torsional spring and dashpot.
<br>
<br>
If a <b>torque</b> is applied to a rotational mechanical system, then it is opposed by opposing torques due to moment of inertia, elasticity and friction of the system. Since the applied torque and the opposing torques are in opposite directions, the algebraic sum of torques acting on the system is zero. Let us now see the torque opposed by these three elements individually.</p>
